# Kubernetes AWS lab environment

## Github actions

This repo is using GH Actions to execute [super-linter](https://github.com/github/super-linter).

I am mostly interested in linting the ansible (YAML), terraform(HCL) and markdown files in the repo using:

- ansible-lint
- markdownlint
- terrascan
- tflint
- yamlint

super-linter is an easy, low maintenance way to do it.
